# MIDI-Player-App
A MIDI Player Android app. Whether this will amount to anything is a question best left to history.

##Notes
This is very likely going to end up being not just a MIDI player, because Android already has the ability to play MIDI files, and there doesn't seem to be any need to make another MIDI player. So in the interest of making this project worthwhile, I might end up incorporating the MIDI-to-Image/Image-to-MIDI thing in it.
